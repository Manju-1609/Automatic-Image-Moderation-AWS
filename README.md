# Research-Paper-Summarization
Objective:
To create a GenAI Assistant that can scan through research papers and provide summaries highlighting key points from documents for researchers, students and engineers. 
Background:
IEEE Xplore is a digital library provided by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). It offers access to a vast collection of research papers, conference proceedings, standards, and other technical literature across various disciplines, primarily focusing on electrical engineering, computer science, and electronics.
Description:
This enables them to go through research paper findings from papers that are too lengthy and get a overview of the a research paper if they lack prior knowledge and find it hard to recognize relevant sections in the base papers.
Tech Stack:
